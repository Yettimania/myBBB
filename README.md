# Beaglebone Black Development

Series of programs written in C for use with the BeagleBone Black. Started with a number of devices I had sitting around.

We love the BeagleBoneBlack and Linux.

## makeLED - Onboard LED

Simple C program that flashes the onboard user LED.

## gpioLED - Basic Example

Connected to a single GPIO pin. It simply blinkds the light a few times. Nothing too exciting.
